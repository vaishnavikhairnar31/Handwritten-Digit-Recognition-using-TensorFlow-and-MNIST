# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-TensorFlow-and-MNIST
A deep learning model using TensorFlow to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset with ~97.8% accuracy.

This project is a beginner-friendly deep learning application that **classifies handwritten digits (0–9)** using the **MNIST dataset** and a **neural network** built with **TensorFlow/Keras**.

** Project 

- Loads and preprocesses the MNIST digit dataset.
- Builds a simple neural network model.
- Trains the model on 60,000 handwritten digit images.
- Evaluates the model on 10,000 unseen test images.
- Logs training accuracy, loss, and digit images to **TensorBoard**.
- Achieves over **92.5% accuracy** in just 5 epochs!


** Use Case

This project is useful for:

- Students learning machine learning or deep learning.
- Beginners practicing TensorFlow & image classification.
- Demonstrating knowledge of model training and evaluation.
- Creating a base for future CNN or deployment projects.


** Dataset: MNIST

- 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0–9).
- Each image is 28x28 pixels.
- Built-in dataset in Keras: `mnist.load_data()`.
